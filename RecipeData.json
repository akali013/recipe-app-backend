Cover and chill for at least 2 hrs, or up to 12 hrs.step 2When ready to cook, heat the grill to high or an oven to 220C\/200C fan\/gas 6. Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions, around 85g each. If you\u2019d like to skewer them, divide into 8 equal portions and roll into balls. Using wet hands, thread the balls onto the end of the skewers, massaging the mixture down the skewers in between the palms of your hands, until evenly distributed. Ensure that the mixture is fully wrapped tightly around the skewers without any exposed metal. Alternatively, lay them on a large baking tray lined with parchment paper if cooking in the oven, or foil if cooking under the grill. Shape into 20cm-long k\u00f6fte.

Add enough oil to a medium skillet with high walls so the oil is about 1\/2 inch up the side of the skillet. Heat oil on medium high heat until it reaches 350\u00b0F. Add egg rolls and fry for 3 to 4 minutes, flip, and fry for another 3 to 4 minutes until golden brown. Remove and let them drain and cool on a few paper towels.Cook the filling:In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil along with the ground pork or chicken. Break apart the meat with a spatula or wooden spoon as it cooks. Cook until the meat is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.Add garlic, ginger, carrot, scallions, and cabbage. Continue to cook until cabbage wilts down and is soft, another 3 to 4 minutes, stirring regularly. Season the filling with soy sauce and rice wine vinegar, and take off the heat to cool. (This filling can be made in advance.)Assemble the egg rolls:Place a single egg roll wrapper on a dry surface with one point of the square facing you (like a diamond). Place about 1\/4 cup of the egg roll filling mixture in the middle of the wrapper.Dip your fingers in water and run around the edges of the wrapper. Then fold the edges of the wrapper over the center and start rolling the egg roll away from you to form a tight cylinder. Place on a plate and repeat until you are out of filling. You should get at least a dozen egg rolls.Air fry the egg rolls:Place the egg rolls in the basket of your air fryer. Spray or brush them lightly with oil. Add as many as you can without stacking the egg rolls, making sure they don\u2019t touch. Air needs to circulate around them. Brush the egg rolls lightly with oil.Place the basket in the air fryer and turn the air fryer to 350\u00b0F. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes, then flip the egg rolls, spray or brush with oil a second time on the bottom side, and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes.Finished egg rolls should be golden brown and crispy!

Pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Apply some oil all over andkeep it for roasting on an open flame. You can also grill the baingan or roast in the oven. But then you won't getthe smoky flavor of the baingan. Keep the eggplant turning after a 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenlycooked. You could also embed some garlic cloves in the baingan and then roast it.2. Roast the aubergine till its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slideasily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it coolsdown.3. You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. This is an optional step.Use natural charcoal for this method. Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red.4. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roastedaubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke.5. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow thecharcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. The more you do, the more smoky the baingan bharta willbecome. I just keep for a minute. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta iscooked, just like the way we do for Dal Tadka.6. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant.7. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it.8. In a kadai or pan, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.9. Saute the onions till translucent. Don't brown them.10.

Working with one sheet of filo at a time (covering the rest with a damp tea towel to prevent it drying out), lay the sheet out on a board so one of the short ends is facing you. Sprinkle 30g of the nut mixture evenly over the whole sheet, then spoon 1 tbsp of the ricotta mixture across the end closest to you. Fold this end over to enclose the filling, then lay a long, thin skewer next to the folded edge and roll the pastry around it to create a long roll. When it\u2019s fully rolled up, it should be roughly the thickness of a chipolata sausage. While holding one end of the rolling pin or skewer, gently scrunch the filo roll like an accordion and carefully push it off the skewer and onto the prepared tray.

If you want to take out the bones they are easy to locate and less likely to be lodged in the fillet if the fish is cooked whole. Fillets can be simply pan-fried or grilled. If you like trout, you will really enjoy the flavour of barramundi, which lends itself to similar ingredients and cooking methods \u2013 citrus flavours are particularly good, as are garlic and wild mushrooms. Simply roasting the fish with some fresh herbs, olive oil and seasoning is delicious, and in the summer months you could barbecue it, too. One thing that you mustn\u2019t miss are the cheeks or \u2018pearls\u2019 of the fish, these are simply lovely, moist and really sweet \u2013 well worth leaving the head on for!","Source":"https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/barramundi-moroccan-spices","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/4o4wh11761848573.jpg"},{"Id":"52894","Name":"Battenberg Cake","Type":"Dessert","Ingredients":"175g Butter\\175g Caster Sugar\\140g Self-raising Flour\\50g Almonds\\\u00bd tsp Baking Powder\\3 Medium Eggs\\\u00bd tsp Vanilla Extract\\\u00bc teaspoon Almond Extract\\175g Butter\\175g Caster Sugar\\140g Self-raising Flour\\50g Almonds\\\u00bd tsp Baking Powder\\3 Medium Eggs\\\u00bd tsp Vanilla Extract\\\u00bc teaspoon Almond Extract\\\u00bd tsp Pink Food Colouring\\200g Apricot\\1kg Marzipan\\","Instructions":"Heat oven to 180C\/160C fan\/gas 4 and line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment (the easiest way is to cross 2 x 20cm-long strips over the base). To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins \u2013 when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.For the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above, but don\u2019t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.To assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake.Take 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.Carefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.Assemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days.

If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.Using a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3\/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.Salt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. 2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.Pat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)Turn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.3 Saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil.Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\u00e9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes. 4 Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven: Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.Move the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop.Cover the pot, place the pot in the 300\u00b0F oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly. 5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.6 Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.To make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and pur\u00e9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.8 Slice the meat across the grain: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the \"grain\" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1\/4-inch to 1\/2-inch slices.Serve with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles or polenta.","Source":"http:\/\/www.simplyrecipes.com\/recipes\/beef_brisket_pot_roast\/","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/ursuup1487348423.jpg"},{"Id":"53070","Name":"Beef Caldereta","Type":"Beef","Ingredients":"2kg cut cubes Beef\\1 Beef Stock\\1 tbs Soy Sauce\\2 cups  Water\\1 sliced Green Pepper\\1 sliced Red Pepper\\1 sliced Potatoes\\1 sliced Carrots\\8 ounces Tomato Puree\\3  tablespoons Peanut Butter\\5 Chilli Powder\\1 chopped Onion\\5 cloves Garlic\\3 tbs Olive Oil\\","Instructions":"0.\tHeat oil in a cooking pot.

Remove the beef from the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard.Lay a sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows. With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle. Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape. Twist the ends of the cling film to secure. Chill for 15-20 mins to allow the beef to set and keep its shape.Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre. Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk. Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess. Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet. Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill for about 15 mins to let the pastry rest.Heat the oven to 200C, 400F, gas 6.Lightly score the pastry at 1cm intervals and glaze again with beaten egg yolk. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180C, 350F, gas 4 and cook for another 15 mins. Allow to rest for 10-15 mins before slicing and serving with the side dishes of your choice. The beef should still be pink in the centre when you serve it.","Source":"http:\/\/www.goodtoknow.co.uk\/recipes\/164868\/Gordon-Ramsay-s-beef-Wellington","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/vvpprx1487325699.jpg"},{"Id":"53307","Name":"Beetroot & red cabbage sauerkraut","Type":"Vegetarian","Ingredients":"320g Beetroot\\450g Red Cabbage\\1 small Onion\\2 tsp Caraway Seed\\1 tsp Sea Salt\\","Instructions":"step 1Tip all the ingredients into a large bowl, add 1-1\u00bd tsp freshly ground black pepper, then scrunch it all together with your hands for 5 mins.

Otherwise it becomes gummy in the skillet.If you don\u2019t have any leftover rice from the night before, cook a batch of rice and spread it on a large baking sheet or several large plates. Let the rice dry out for about 1 to 2 hours before using it for fried rice.Rice sticks to the pan very easily, so make sure to use a wok or pan that doesn\u2019t have a sticky surface. I usually cook stir-fries in my seasoned carbon steel wok, but cast iron or nonstick pans work well, too. You might need to add a little more oil if things aren\u2019t releasing easily.Prepare the chicken:Chop the chicken into small 1\/4-inch to 1\/2-inch cubes. Sprinkle 1\/2 teaspoon of salt over the chicken and mix to combine. Set the chicken aside for about 10 minutes (I usually use this time to chop all the vegetables).Scramble the egg:Heat a wok or large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat. Swirl in a tablespoon of oil and add the whisked eggs. Use a spatula to quickly scramble the eggs, breaking the curds into smaller pieces as they come together. Transfer the eggs to a plate.Cook the chicken:Add another tablespoon of oil in the wok or pan. Add the chicken and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and transfer the cooked chicken to a plate.Using your spatula, scrape off any chicken bits that are still stuck to the wok so they don't burn during the next step. You can also use paper towels to wipe down your wok or pan.Cook the vegetables:Swirl 1 tablespoon of oil into the wok over medium-high heat. Add the diced onions and cook them for 1 minute, until they start to soften. Mix in the minced garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the diced carrots and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add 1\/2 teaspoon salt and the peas, and stir to incorporate.Cook the rice:Add the rice to the wok or pan on top of the vegetables and stir to combine. Using the back of your spatula, smash any large chunks of rice to break them apart. Add the white and green parts of the sliced scallions (save the dark green parts) and five-spice powder. Stir to incorporate. If the rice starts to stick to the pan, stir in a little more oil.Drizzle the soy sauce and sesame oil over the rice and stir to incorporate. Stir in the cooked chicken, scrambled eggs, and the dark parts of the scallions. Stir briefly to bring it together, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.Serve:Taste, and add more soy sauce if necessary.

Bake in the oven for 45 mins.Lower the oven temperature to 160C\/140 C fan\/Gas Mark 3 and cook for a further 60\u201380 minutes. Check the cake after 50 minutes by inserting a wooden or metal skewer into the cake. When it\u2019s done it should have just a few crumbs attached. Check every 10 minutes - it\u2019s important not to overcook this cake so the centre will be a little soft.When cooked, remove the cake briefly from the oven, put the milk and sugar into a small pan and heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Brush over the top of the cake and return the cake to the oven for 2-3 mins. Remove and allow the cake to cool in the tin. When quite cold remove from the tin and wrap in foil and keep for at least 2 days before cutting.","Source":"https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/2155640\/dundee-cake","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wxyvqq1511723401.jpg"},{"Id":"53379","Name":"Dutch poffertjes (mini pancakes)","Type":"Breakfast","Ingredients":"125g Flour\\125g Buckwheat Flour\\2 Eggs\\1 knob Butter\\300ml  Milk\\10g Yeast\\1tsp vanilla sugar\\To serve Butter\\To serve Icing Sugar\\","Instructions":"Mix the dry yeast with some of the luke warm milk en stir until dissolved.Place buckwheat and the flour together in a bowl and make a small circle in the middle.

Add the sausages to the hot grill plate\/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.Snip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.For the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.For the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre\/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.For the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1\u00bd-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.For 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.For the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash\/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.Once all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.","Source":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/stressfreefullenglis_67721","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/utxryw1511721587.jpg"},{"Id":"53149","Name":"Ensaimada","Type":"Dessert","Ingredients":"5g Yeast\\200g Caster Sugar\\2 medium Egg\\600g Strong white bread flour\\Drizzle Vegetable Oil\\100g  Lard\\","Instructions":"step 1Pour 230ml lukewarm water into a bowl and add the yeast.

Cook the drained beans in a fresh portion of unsalted water in a large saucepan with the lid on until tender, adding water to keep them covered, and salt when the beans have softened. They take 2\u20132 1\/2 hours of gentle simmering. When the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce. It is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans. This is to thicken the sauce.Serve the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with chopped parsley and accompanied by Arab bread.Pass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil, the quartered lemons, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chili-pepper flakes, and one with ground cumin.The beans are eaten gently crushed with the fork, so that they absorb the dressing.Optional GarnishesPeel hard-boiled eggs\u20141 per person\u2014to cut up in the bowl with the beans.Top the beans with a chopped cucumber-and-tomato salad and thinly sliced mild onions or scallions. Otherwise, pass round a good bunch of scallions and quartered tomatoes and cucumbers cut into sticks.Serve with tahina cream sauce (page 65) or salad (page 67), with pickles and sliced onions soaked in vinegar for 30 minutes.Another way of serving ful medames is smothered in a garlicky tomato sauce (see page 464).In Syria and Lebanon, they eat ful medames with yogurt or feta cheese, olives, and small cucumbers.VariationsA traditional way of thickening the sauce is to throw a handful of red lentils (1\/4 cup) into the water at the start of the cooking.In Iraq, large brown beans are used instead of the small Egyptian ones, in a dish called badkila, which is also sold for breakfast in the street.","Source":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/ful-medames-352993","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/lvn2d51598732465.jpg"},{"Id":"52896","Name":"Full English Breakfast","Type":"Breakfast","Ingredients":"4 Sausages\\4 Bacon\\4 Mushrooms\\3 Tomatoes\\2 sliced Black Pudding\\2 Eggs\\1 Slice Bread\\100g  Baked Beans\\","Instructions":"Heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings\/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil.Cook the sausages first. Add the sausages to the hot grill plate\/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.Snip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.For the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.For the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre\/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.For the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1\u00bd-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.For 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.For the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash\/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.Once all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.","Source":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/stressfreefullenglis_67721","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/sqrtwu1511721265.jpg"},{"Id":"53131","Name":"Fyrstekake \u2013 Norwegian Prince Cake","Type":"Dessert","Ingredients":"3\/4 cup  Granulated Sugar\\1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract\\2\/3 Cup Butter\\4 Egg Yolks\\2 cups  Flour\\1 teaspoon Baking Powder\\1 1\/2 cups  Almonds\\3\/4 cup Brown Sugar\\2 tbsp Melted Butter\\2 medium Egg\\2 tablespoons Brandy\\5 drops Almond Extract\\1 Egg\\","Instructions":"Crust\u25a2Mix together sugar, vanilla and butter until light and fluffy.

Gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Then stir in the drained cooked pasta.5. Line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter. Pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. Coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.Make the grilled cheese6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended.8. Remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Carefully cut into 8 equal pieces. Each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (You can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.)9. Spread 3\/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. Place half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. Top each with one slice of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (Transfer from the baking sheet by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each. Finish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up.10. Using a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. Cover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more.11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Cut the sandwiches in half, if desired, and serve.","Source":"https:\/\/leitesculinaria.com\/103647\/recipes-grilled-mac-and-cheese-sandwich.html","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/xutquv1505330523.jpg"},{"Id":"53041","Name":"Grilled Portuguese sardines","Type":"Seafood","Ingredients":"8 Sardines\\2 tbs Olive Oil\\3 cloves Garlic\\1 tbs Paprika\\1\/2  Lemon\\4 sprigs Rosemary\\1 Red Chilli\\","Instructions":"STEP 1Put all of the ingredients, except the sardines, into a bowl and mix together with some seasoning.

Take a bowl with a wide rim (about 5 inches) and cut out three circles.Place about 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling onto 1\/2 of each circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal. Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue to work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties.Second Method: If you had pre-cut the dough into individual pieces, work with one piece of dough at a time. Roll it out on a floured surface into a 5-inch circle or a little larger. Don\u2019t worry if the edges are not perfect.Place 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling on one side of the circle.

Set aside. Deep fry the sliced onions when it is hot. Don\u2019t overcrowd the oil. When the onions turn light brown, remove from oil and drain on paper towel. The fried onion will crisp up as it drains. Also fry the cashewnuts till golden brown. Set aside.Wash the rice and soak in water for twenty minutes.Meanwhile, take a big wide pan, add oil in medium heat, add the sliced onions, add the blended paste, to it add the green chillies, ginger garlic paste and garlic and fry for a minute.Then add the tomatoes and saut\u00e9 them well till they are cooked and not mushy.Then to it add the red chilli powder, biryani powder, mint, coriander leaves and saut\u00e9 them well.Add the yogurt and mix well.

If you are cooking in oven, do make sure to cook in a big oven safe pan and cover it tight and then keep in oven for the final step.2. You can skip biryani masala if you don\u2019t have and add just garam masala (1 tsp and red chilli powder \u2013 3 tsp instead of 1 tsp)3.

Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. Basmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four.First make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.To make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.While the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.Lay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).Pour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.","Source":"http:\/\/www.ottolenghi.co.uk\/recipes\/meat\/lamb-tomato-and-sweet-spices-shop","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/qtwtss1468572261.jpg"},{"Id":"53010","Name":"Lamb Tzatziki Burgers","Type":"Lamb","Ingredients":"25g Bulgur Wheat\\500g Lamb Mince\\1 tsp  Cumin\\1 tsp  Coriander\\1 tsp  Paprika\\1 clove finely chopped Garlic\\For frying Olive Oil\\4 Bun\\Grated Cucumber\\200g Greek Yogurt\\2 tbs Mint\\","Instructions":"Tip the bulghar into a pan, cover with water and boil for 10 mins.

You can find it at an Asian grocery store in the frozen or refrigerated section. Look for small-sized dried shrimp, about a 1\/4-inch in size. If you use medium or large dried shrimp, hydrate the shrimp with more water (1 cup for medium-sized shrimp, 1 1\/4 cup for large) and for longer time (45 to 60 minutes), then chop it up into smaller 1\/4-inch chunks. To make this recipe vegetarian, omit the dried shrimp and use four or five dried shiitake mushrooms, rehydrated, and sliced thin.Rehydrate the dried shrimp:Place the dried shrimp in a small bowl and pour the boiling water over it. Cover with a small plate and let sit for 30 minutes so the shrimp can rehydrate. The shrimp will be lighter in color and plump up slightly.Prep the cabbage:Meanwhile, split the napa cabbage in half lengthwise. Rinse the cabbage and shake it dry. Cut out the core of the cabbage and discard.Set out two large bowls. Cut the remaining cabbage into 1-inch pieces, putting the thicker white pieces at the bottom of the cabbage into one bowl and the top thinner leafy green pieces into the other bowl.Drain the shrimp:Once the shrimp has rehydrated, drain it and discard the liquid.Cook the shrimp and cabbage:In a large wok or skillet over high heat add the peanut oil, swirling it around to coat the pan.Heat until the oil looks shimmering hot, then carefully add the scallions, ginger, and rehydrated shrimp, paying specially attention as the wet ingredients may cause the hot oil to splatter. Toss with a spatula until the scallions are bright green and the entire mixture is fragrant, about 1 minute.Add the thicker white part of the napa cabbage to the pan and lower the heat to medium high. Continue to cook and stir for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the edges of the cabbage pieces start to look slightly translucent but the center of the cabbage pieces are still opaque white.Reduce the heat to medium low and add the leafy green pieces of cabbage into the pan. Cook until the leaves are wilted, about 2 minutes.Make a cornstarch slurry:In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, cold water, and cornstarch, stirring to make a slurry. Then pour over the cabbage and continue to cook and stir until a sauce has thickened slightly to the consistency of whole milk.Season the stir fry:Season the stir fry with salt and pepper, then taste and add more salt and pepper if you wish. The cabbage will be translucent and silky looking, with specks of dried shrimp all over.","Source":"https:\/\/www.simplyrecipes.com\/napa-cabbage-dried-shrimp-recipe-5208805","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/9nh4dl1766435484.jpg"},{"Id":"53051","Name":"Nasi lemak","Type":"Seafood","Ingredients":"2 cups  Coconut Milk\\2 cups  Water\\1\/4 tsp Ginger Paste\\1 Ginger\\1 Bay Leaf\\2 cups  Rice\\4 Eggs\\1 Cucumber\\1 cup  Peanuts\\4 oz  Anchovy Fillet\\2 tbs Vegetable Oil\\1 Onion\\3 cloves Garlic\\3 Shallots\\2 tsp Chilli Powder\\4 oz  Anchovy Fillet\\3 tbs Sugar\\1\/3 cup Tamarind Paste\\","Instructions":"In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together coconut milk, water, ground ginger, ginger root, salt, bay leaf, and rice.

Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy.Brush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to fan 90C\/conventional 110C\/gas 1\u20444 and bake for 25 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools.Combine the reserved soured cream with the 142ml carton, the sugar and lemon juice for the topping.

Season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper. One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. Discard the remaining flour.Browning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won\u2019t fit without touching one another, do this in batches. Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit. Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside.The aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits. Ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat. When the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrot, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and bay leaf, and stew for another minute or two.The braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes. Add the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes.The braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat. Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch. Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer. Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees. Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours.The gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.)The finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata. Return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some.Using a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact. The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky. But if they do break apart, don\u2019t worry, the flavor won\u2019t suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.Finishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes. Taste again for salt and pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata.Portioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person. If the shanks are gargantuan or you\u2019re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most.Serving: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce \u2013 the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone\u2019s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.","Source":"https:\/\/www.cookstr.com\/Meat\/Osso-Buco-alla-Milanese","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wwuqvt1487345467.jpg"},{"Id":"52943","Name":"Oxtail with broad beans","Type":"Beef","Ingredients":"450g Oxtail\\1 chopped Onion\\1 Spring Onions\\2 cloves minced Garlic\\1 tsp  Ginger\\1 chopped Scotch Bonnet\\2 tbs Soy Sauce\\1 chopped Fresh Thyme\\2 tbs Vegetable Oil\\350ml Water\\200g Broad Beans\\1 tbs Corn Flour\\2 tbs Water\\","Instructions":"Toss the oxtail with the onion, spring onion, garlic, ginger, chilli, soy sauce, thyme, salt and pepper.

Leave to marinate for 20-30 minutes, while you get your barbecue to the stage where the coals are glowing but there are no flames.STEP 3To make the chips, fill a basin with cool water and cut the potatoes into 3cm-thick chips. Soak them in the water for 5 minutes and then change the water. Leave for 5 more minutes. Drain and then pat dry on a towel or with kitchen paper.STEP 4Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a deep heavy-based pan with a lid to 130C and lower the chips into the oil (in batches).

Line bottom with parchment paper. Then divide the eggs into egg white and egg yolks. Use a bigger bowl for the egg yolks. If you have a glass or metal bowl, use that one for the egg whites. Be sure that bowl is free of fat\/grease and that your mixer was properly cleaned. First beat the egg whites on medium speed with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Set aside. Without cleaning our mixer, beat the egg yolks with the sugar. Beat until the color becomes much paler and you have a creamy consistency. This usually takes several minutes.2Gently pour one third of the egg whites on top of the mixed egg yolks and sift the flour and cornstarch on top. Don't skip this step. It is important that the flour mix was sifted. Gently mix all ingredients with a spatula. Try to incorperate the flour mix and egg whites without losing volume. Add the last two thirds of beaten egg whites and gently fold the mixture. Don't overmix. Put batter into the prepared cake pans and immediately bake. Don't let the batter sit for too long as it will quickly lose volume. Bake for 35 minutes if using one springform or 25 minutes if using two. Let cool a little before gently getting them out of the form. Tip: if making the day before, wrap in cling wrap, it is much easier to cut in half once cold.3For the meringue beat egg white until soft peaks form, add pinch of salt and continue beating on high while adding the sugar. Beat for at least three more minutes until glossy and shiny. Pipe small stars or other shapes with the meringue on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Dry for about 45min at 100 degrees Celsius in the oven. Keep in airtight container until further use.4For the filling beat heavy cream, vanilla extract and sugar until stiff peaks form, slice peaches in thin slices. Cut cake in four layers, this is much easier done once the cake layers are cold. Brush cake layer with some of the peach juice left, then pipe thin layer of whipped cream around the edges, place the peach slices in the middle on first layer on cake, on the second layer only spread the dulce de leche. Repeat layer with brushed peach juice, whipped cream and peaches for the third and final layer. Be sure to reserve enough peach slices for the top. Spread thin layer of whipped cream on the sides of the cake and pipe on some roses around the edges if desired. Heat the peach juice and mix the cornstarch with a bit of water until you see no lumps. Once juice is hot, add the cornstarch and stir until glaze thickenes. Pour over peaches of the top layer cake. Crush the meringue and pat around the sides. Serve immediately.","Source":"https:\/\/jennyisbaking.com\/2018\/08\/31\/uruguays-version-of-a-peach-layer-cake-postre-chaja\/#recipe","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wii0591764375062.jpg"},{"Id":"52780","Name":"Potato Gratin with Chicken","Type":"Chicken","Ingredients":"800g Potatoes\\3 Onions\\2 tblsp Olive Oil\\100ml Chicken Stock\\1 pot Creme Fraiche\\Topping Parmesan\\4 Chicken Breasts\\4 Bacon\\Topping Spinach\\Topping Peas\\","Instructions":"15 minute potato gratin with chicken and bacon greens: a gratin always seems more effort and more indulgent than ordinary boiled or roasts, but it doesn't have to take 45mins, it's nice for a change and you can control the calorie content by going with full fat to low fat creme fraiche.

Mix well. Add the cubes of butter and shortening and mix them in (I like to use my hands to mix the fat into the flour, but you can use a pastry blender) just until it looks like coarse oatmeal with some pea-sized bits remaining. Place the egg in a 2-cup measure and beat it with a fork. Beat in the vinegar and just enough ice-cold water to bring it to the 1-cup mark. Stir this into the flour mixture, just until the dough clings together. I like to use my hands for this part as well, but a wooden spoon would also work. Try not to overmix it.On a lightly floured surface, gather the dough into a ball and divide it into 5 evenly sized portions. Shape each portion into a disc and wrap tightly in plastic. Chill 2 of these discs for 1 hour. Freeze the other 3 in a resealable freezer bag for future use. The pastry keeps well in the freezer for up to 2 months.Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Place the rack in the lower third of the oven. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil to catch drippings.On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 disc of pastry into a 12-inch circle, or thereabouts. Place it in the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate, with the pastry overhanging the edges of the pie plate.To make the filling, place the saskatoon berries in a large bowl and stir in the 1\/2 cup sugar and the cornstarch until well combined. Pour the berry mixture into the bottom of the pie. Dot with the butter. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry in another 12-inch circle for the top crust. Use a ruler to guide you when cutting the pastry into 6 wide, long strips to keep the edges straight. Save the 2 end pieces in case you need to do any patching. I like wide strips, but if you like a thinner look, feel free to cut thin strips of pastry. Weave the pastry strips, going over and under, making sure they connect with the edges of the pie crust. Fold over the edges of the bottom crust, tucking in the lattice ends. This will help to trap the juices and give a rustic look.If you prefer a cleaner, tidier look, you can trim the overhanging pieces and crimp the edges with a fork. Brush the top of the pie with the egg wash. Sprinkle with the remaining Tbsp sugar. Place the pie on the prepared baking sheet and bake it for about 90 \u2013 100 minutes, until it\u2019s golden brown and bubbling. Remove the pie from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool.Serve the pie warm or at room temperature with whipped cream or ice cream. Makes 6 servings. This keeps well if covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 4 days.","Source":"https:\/\/canadianfoodfocus.org\/canadian-food-stories\/classic-canadian-recipes-saskatoon-pie\/#recipe","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/5xdrkw1764444472.jpg"},{"Id":"53296","Name":"Sauerkraut pierogi","Type":"Vegetarian","Ingredients":"1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil\\2 Shallots\\150g Sauerkraut\\150g Hispi (sweetheart) Cabbage\\1 large Egg\\1\/2 tbs Vegetable Oil\\350g Plain Flour\\For frying Vegetable Oil\\2 Shallots\\Dusting Plain Flour\\45g Butter\\60 ml  Sour Cream\\","Instructions":"step 1First, make the crispy shallots.

They are long and thin compared to a European or globe eggplant, and much more tender and delicate. If you can't find them you can substitute globe eggplant, but the dish is really best with the asian eggplant.*A lot of grocery stores have Asian ingredient aisles now. You should be able to find chili-bean paste, a mixture of preserved chilies mixed with mashed soybeans, there or at any Asian market. (Do not confuse with black bean paste or chili-garlic paste.)**Sichuan peppercorns are available at some stores and online for quite cheap. They aren't spicy like other peppers but rather have a citrusy flavor and induce a tingly, numbing sensation like a carbonated drink.Prep eggplant, chili sauce, cornstarch slurry, vinegar and scallions:Begin your mise en place. Quarter the eggplant lengthwise and chop into large batons and set aside.In a small bowl, mix together the chicken stock, sugar, and soy sauce and set it aside.In a second bowl, mix together the chili bean paste, garlic, ginger, and sichuan peppercorns and set it aside.In a third bowl, mix together the cornstarch with a tablespoon of water and set it aside.Lastly, in a fourth bowl, mix together the scallions and vinegar and set it aside.Saut\u00e9 eggplant:Place the oil in a wok or large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat until the oil is almost smoking. Add the eggplant and saut\u00e9, allowing it to sit for a few seconds each time you move it to allow it to brown and blister. If the eggplant absorbs all the oil and some pieces don't get any then add a little more oil.Add the chili bean paste, garlic, ginger, and sichuan peppercorns and saut\u00e9:until fragrant, about 30 seconds.Add the chicken stock mixture:turn the heat to medium-low and simmer for 90 seconds.Add the cornstarch mixture:and stir together until the sauce thickens a bit.Add the scallions and vinegar:and cook for 15 seconds to diffuse their harsh flavors a bit.Garnish with cilantro and serve.","Source":"https:\/\/www.simplyrecipes.com\/recipes\/sichuan_eggplant\/","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/1oz4nb1765687990.jpg"},{"Id":"53371","Name":"Sichuan Style Stir-Fried Chinese Long Beans","Type":"Vegetarian","Ingredients":"1\/2 lb Chinese Long Beans\\1 tablespoon Peanut Oil\\6 Dried Chillies\\1 tsp Sichuan Pepper\\1\/4 tsp Salt\\1\/2 tsp Sugar\\1 tablespoon Sesame Seed Oil\\Splash Soy Sauce\\","Instructions":"Chinese long beans can be found in both green and purple varieties.

Leave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. Stir in the vanilla extract. Butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml\/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat oven to 180C\/fan 160C\/gas 4.While the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour and milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm.Meanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream.Remove the puddings from the oven. Leave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out. You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they\u2019ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce.

Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarsemeal (about 15 seconds). Pour 1\/4 cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds.Turn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour. After the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).)  Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1\/2 inch (1.5 cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling. Remove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3\/4 inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes. Make the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon. Remove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the fruit with about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.Remove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. Lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang. Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.)Place the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble.Remove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Reheat before serving. This pie can be frozen.Makes one 9 inch (23 cm) pie.","Source":"https:\/\/www.joyofbaking.com\/StrawberryRhubarbPie.html","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/178z5o1585514569.jpg"},{"Id":"53067","Name":"Stuffed Bell Peppers with Quinoa and Black Beans","Type":"Vegetarian","Ingredients":"4 whole Green Pepper\\1 tablespoon Olive Oil\\1 small finely diced Onion\\2 cloves minced Garlic\\1 cups Quinoa\\1 can  Black Beans\\1 cup  Sweetcorn\\1 can  Diced Tomatoes\\1 teaspoon Cumin\\\u00bd tsp Chili Powder\\\u00bd tsp Smoked Paprika\\To taste Salt\\To taste Pepper\\1 1\/2 cup  Shredded Mexican Cheese\\Chopped Cilantro\\","Instructions":"1.

Sprinkle the Parmesan into the ramekins, turning until all sides are covered. Place the milk and bay leaves in a large saucepan over a gentle heat and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 mins.Discard the bay leaves, add the butter and flour, and return to a low heat. Very gently simmer, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 mins until you get a smooth, thick white sauce. Make sure that you get right into the corners of the pan to stop the sauce from catching or becoming lumpy.Once thickened, transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, cayenne pepper, Gruy\u00e8re and egg yolks until fully combined.In a spotlessly clean bowl and with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites just until peaks begin to form.Carefully fold the egg whites into the cheese sauce in three stages making sure you fold, rather than stir, to keep the egg whites light and airy. Fill the prepared ramekins with the souffl\u00e9 mix.Top each souffl\u00e9 with a slice of goat\u2019s cheese, then place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-25 mins or until springy and well risen but cooked through.Leave to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each dish and remove the souffl\u00e9s. If preparing in advance, place souffl\u00e9s upside down (for neat presentation), on a tray. Cover tray in cling film. Chill for a few days or freeze for up to 1 month.When ready to re-bake, heat oven to 200C\/180C fan\/gas 6. Place the upside-down souffl\u00e9s in a shallow baking dish, top with the remaining goat\u2019s cheese slices and pour over the cream (this stops them from drying out when baked for the second time). Cook for 8-10 mins until golden. Serve immediately alongside some simply dressed salad.","Source":"https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/3028701\/threecheese-souffls","ImageUrl":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/sxwquu1511793428.jpg"},{"Id":"52929","Name":"Timbits","Type":"Dessert","Ingredients":"2 cups  Flour\\1\/3 cup Sugar\\3 tsp Baking Powder\\\u00bd tsp Salt\\1 beaten Egg\\\u00be cup Milk\\3 tbs Oil\\for frying Oil\\garnish Icing Sugar\\","Instructions":"Sift together dry ingredients.Mix together wet ingredients and incorporate into dry.

Add about three tablespoons of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 200C\/400F\/Gas 6 and put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm\/7in loose-bottomed fluted flan tin with butter.Remove about 150g\/5\u00bdoz of pastry from the main ball and set aside for the lattice top.Roll the rest of the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin with the pastry.Prick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up during baking.Place the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture.To make the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil.Once melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.Pour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.Remove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm\/\u00bdin wide. Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.Egg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.Once the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish.Bake on the pre-heated baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4.
